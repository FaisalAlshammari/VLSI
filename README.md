# VLSI
VLSI is an integrated circuit with millions of transistors on one chip. 

#### Tools:
**Logisim tool** is an educational tool for designing and simulating digital logic circuits\
**Magic tool** a venerable VLSI layout tool used for designing circuit and testing it.

#### Here some of the project I worked on:
- Designing a [Comparator](Comparator) and testing it using (Logisim tool)
- Designing a [3BitCounter](3BitCounter) and tesing it using Logisim tool, then Implementing it using (Magic tool).
