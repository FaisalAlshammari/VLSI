# VLSI
VLSI is an integrated circuit with millions of transistors on one chip.\
In this project, I designed and tested the circuit using Logisim which is a simulation environment for designing hardware [Comparator](Comparator).\
Then implemented my design in a layout tool In the Second Phase (Magic VLSI).  <!--[MagicTool](Comparator)-->
